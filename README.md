# -Different-Types-Of-Data-Preprocessing-Methods-With-Sudo-Code

Data preprocessing is a pivotal phase in the data analysis journey. It encompasses refining and reshaping raw data to a structure conducive for seamless analysis and modeling. This encompasses tasks such as rectifying missing data, addressing outliers, standardizing and rescaling data, encoding categorical variables, and various other operations aimed at elevating data quality and fortifying the precision of analytical models.

Handling Missing Values

Use Case: To address missing data in a dataset to improve model accuracy.
Steps:
Identify missing values.
Decide whether to fill or drop them.
Implement the chosen method.
Python Code:

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")
# Fill missing values
data.fillna(value, inplace=True)
# Or drop missing values
data.dropna(inplace=True)
Handling Outliers

Use Case: To minimize the impact of outliers on model performance.
Steps:
Identify outliers.
Decide whether to transform, replace, or remove them.
Implement the chosen method.
Python Code:
